# ðŸ”„ EIP-3675: Upgrade Consensus to Proof-of-Stake

**Status:** Final  
**Link:** [EIP-3675 on eips.ethereum.org](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675)

---

## Overview
EIP-3675 formalized Ethereumâ€™s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This proposal defined how Ethereumâ€™s mainnet merged with the Beacon Chain, eliminating mining and adopting validator-based consensus.

---

## Key Points
- Established a **terminal total difficulty (TTD)** to trigger the Merge.  
- Deprecated PoW block validation, replaced with PoS logic.  
- Updated block headers and fork choice rules.  
- Removed mining-based rewards, introducing staking incentives instead.  

---

## Impact
Enabled *The Merge*, reducing Ethereumâ€™s energy consumption by ~99.95% and laying the foundation for future scalability.

---

## Conclusion
Transformed Ethereumâ€™s security model and environmental impact, marking a new era for the networkâ€™s consensus mechanism.
