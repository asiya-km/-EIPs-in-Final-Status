# ðŸª™ EIP-1559: Fee Market Change for ETH 1.0 Chain

**Status:** Final  
**Link:** [EIP-1559 on eips.ethereum.org](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)

---

## Overview
EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction fee mechanism to replace the traditional first-price auction model. Instead of users bidding blindly for gas, a base fee is automatically adjusted according to network demand and burned rather than paid to miners.

---

## Key Points
- Introduces a dynamic base fee that adjusts based on block congestion.  
- Users pay `max_fee = base_fee + tip`, where the base fee is burned and tip goes to the miner.  
- Helps make transaction fees more predictable.  
- Adds a deflationary element to ETH since part of the fees are destroyed.  

---

## Impact
EIP-1559 improved user experience, stabilized gas prices, and reduced ETH inflation. Itâ€™s considered one of Ethereumâ€™s most impactful upgrades since it changed the networkâ€™s economic model.

---

## Conclusion
Represents a critical shift toward predictable gas pricing and sustainable token economics for Ethereum.
