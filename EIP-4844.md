# ðŸ’¾ EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions

**Status:** Final  
**Link:** [EIP-4844 on eips.ethereum.org](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)

---

## Overview
EIP-4844 introduces blob-carrying transactions, which include large chunks of data (called blobs) not directly accessible by the EVM but used to improve data availability for Layer 2 rollups.

---

## Key Points
- Adds a new transaction type for storing blob data.  
- Blob data is temporary and cheaper than normal calldata.  
- Significantly lowers costs for rollups (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum).  
- Forms a foundation for future full sharding upgrades.  

---

## Impact
By reducing data storage costs and increasing throughput, EIP-4844 accelerates Ethereumâ€™s roadmap toward scalability and efficiency.

---

## Conclusion
A vital step in making Ethereum rollup-centric, improving performance without sacrificing decentralization.
